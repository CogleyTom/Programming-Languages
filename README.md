# CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
**This Project was my final project in my Computer Science Programming Languages Class.
In this project I was required to combine Python and C++. It was a grocery item project.
I had to create a user interface in C++ on what the user wanted to do with a text grocery list.
If the user selected to produce a list of all items purchased in the day it would go through Python
loop through the text file and produce a list of all items and how many were in the list. If the user
chose to look for a certain item they would select that option and type it in. The program then uses Python
to loop through the txt file find the exact string match and print how many times it was in the list. If the 
user wanted to produce a histogram listing they would select that option. The program will then go through Python
loop through the text file and for every duplicate would add an asterick next to the item and finally wrote that 
text file to a .dat file and allowed my C++ program to read it. Finally if the user wished to quit the program they 
could input the button to quit.**

What did you do particularly well?
**I was able to catch all errors very well. Also, the Python code I wrote was very proficient especially the string match
function to capture the exact word a user inputted. Also, looping through every function if a user inputted the wrong 
information worked out well.**

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
**There are a few places I could enhance my code. For security purposes I could've used private class identifiers.
Also, I could have used a switch statement instead of an if statement for optimization.**

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
**The most difficult part I had on my project was exact string match in Python. I had to research exactly how to do it and kept 
utilizing trial and error to get it to function correctly. There are many resources online that I utilize to help me solve my 
programming roadblocks. Sometimes on reddit or sometimes on GitHub.**

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
**Skills from this project that will help me with other projects or coursework include thinking of all possible errors
and accounting for them. Also, writing down exactly what I want my program to accomplish. Finally, constantly compiling
my code to ensure it is working as intended.**

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
**To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I used many comments throughout. Also, I tried to keep
the code very simple and not write many lines of code to accomplish one thing.**
